 The MUDOGER is a pipeline which was developed for the metagenomic analysis of data from Prokaryotes, Viruses and Eykaryotes . For this purpose, MUDOGER combines the 
 utillization of known analytical pipelines: **Metawrap, Virsorter, Virfinder, Vibrant and Eykarep**

# OVERVIEW OF THE MUDOGER

* **Installation** 
* **Quality control:** Trimming of the reads and removal of possible host reads
* **Assembly:** Assembly of "good quality" sequences
* **METAWRAP pipeline:** R: Metagenomic analysis of  prokaryotic genomes
* **VirFinder, VirSorter, Vibrant pipelines:**
* **EykRep pipeline:**
