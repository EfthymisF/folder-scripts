 The MUDOGER is a pipeline which was developed for the metagenomic analysis of data from Prokaryotes, Viruses and Eykaryotes . For this purpose, MUDOGER combines the 
 utillization of known analytical pipelines: **Metawrap, Virsorter, Virfinder, Vibrant and Eykarep**
 

## MUDOGER Workflow
* **(1)** Trimming of the Metagenomic library and removal of all the host reads by running  metaWRAP-Read_qc

# OVERVIEW OF THE MUDOGER

* **Installation** 
* **Quality control:** Trimming of the reads and removal of possible host reads
* **Assembly:** Assembly of "good quality" sequences
* **METAWRAP pipeline:** R: Metagenomic analysis of prokaryotic genomes
* **VirFinder, VirSorter, Vibrant pipelines:** Metagenomic analysis of viral sequences 
* **EykRep pipeline:** Metagenomic analysis of Eykaryotic genomes
 
 
 In the pre-processing modules the reads are trimming and any read coming from a host is removed and the resulted metagenomic data are assembled
